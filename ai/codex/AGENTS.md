## Language Guidance

### Rust

- Do NOT use unwraps or anything that can panic in Rust code, handle errors. Obviously in tests unwraps and panics are fine!
- In Rust code I prefer using `crate::` to `super::`; please don't use `super::`. If you see a lingering `super::` from someone else clean it up.
- Avoid `pub use` on imports unless you are re-exposing a dependency so downstream consumers do not have to depend on it directly.
- Skip global state via `lazy_static!`, `Once`, or similar; prefer passing explicit context structs for any shared state.

#### Rust Workflow Checklist

1. Run `cargo fmt`.
1. Run `cargo clippy --all --benches --tests --examples --all-features` and address warnings.
1. Execute the relevant `cargo test` or `just` targets to cover unit and end-to-end paths.

## Final Handoff

Before finishing a task:

1. Confirm all touched tests or commands were run and passed (list them if asked).
1. Summarize changes with file and line references.
1. Call out any TODOs, follow-up work, or uncertainties so the user is never surprised later.

### TypeScript

- In TypeScript codebases NEVER, EVER use `any` we are better than that. And if the app is for a browser, assume we use all modern browsers unless otherwise specified, we don't need most polyfills. Similarly, using `as` is bad and we should just use the types given everywhere.

### Python

- **Python repos standard**. We use `uv` and `pyproject.toml` in all Python repos. Prefer `uv sync` for env and dependency resolution. Do not introduce `pip` venvs, Poetry, or `requirements.txt` unless asked.

## Dependencies & External APIs

- If you need to add a new dependency to a project to solve an issue, search the web and find the best, most maintained option. Something most other folks use with the best exposed API. We don't want to be in a situation where we are using an unmaintained dependency, that no one else relies on.

## Secrets & Local Shell State

- Never inspect, print, dump, or verify environment variables or shell-local configuration to confirm credentials or setup.
- Never read files like `locals.fish`, `.zshrc`, `.zprofile`, `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `config.fish`, or similar shell startup or local secret-bearing files unless the user explicitly asks for that file to be edited.
- Do not run commands like `env`, `printenv`, `set`, `export`, or equivalent probes for this purpose.
- If authentication or local setup may be the issue, run the target tool or command directly and report the failure without probing the environment first.
